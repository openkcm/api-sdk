## Using a specific branch

Ensure that the GOPRIVATE environment variable is set up:

   ```sh
     go env -w GOPRIVATE="github.com/*"  
   ```

To use a specific branch of a repository in your Go project, you can use the `go get` command with the branch name.
Here's an example:

> go get github.com/openkcm/api-sdk/proto/kms/api/cmk/registry/system/v1@<branch-name>

To switch back to the default branch, follow these steps:

1. Update your dependencies to the latest version on the default branch:

> go get github.com/openkcm/api-sdk/proto/kms/api/cmk/registry/system/v1@latest

2. Clean up:

```sh
  go mod tidy
```
